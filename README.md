## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have the correct Node.js version installed. We recommend using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions.

```bash
# Install or switch to the Node.js version specified in .nvmrc (v18.17.0)
$ nvm use
```

If you don't have the required Node.js version installed yet (v18.17.0), you can do so using the following command:

```bash
$ nvm install v18.17.0
```

After installing the correct Node.js version, you can proceed to install the project dependencies using Yarn. Please note that Yarn is the recommended package manager for this project.

# Install project dependencies

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Now, you can run the development server:

# Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## To-Do and Improvements
